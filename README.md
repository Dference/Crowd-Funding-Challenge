# Python Challenge

## A Tale of Two Challenges

In the first Challenge, we are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a subject company with a given financial dataset. The dataset was composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
Our task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In the second Challenge, we are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. We were given a set of poll data, the dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Our task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote
